# DEBUGGING STEPS

## Step 1: Test with Browser Console
1. Edit a payment with files
2. Check console for "Loaded existing files:"
3. Delete one file
4. Check console for "Before removal" and "After removal"
5. Click save
6. Check console for "Existing files before sending:"
7. Check console for "FormData contents:"

## Step 2: Check Laravel Logs
1. Monitor: `Get-Content storage/logs/laravel.log -Wait -Tail 10`
2. Look for "Starting updateMultiple transaction"
3. Look for "File handling started"
4. Look for "File deletion process started"

## Step 3: Quick Test
Try this in browser console after editing payment:
```javascript
console.log('Existing files:', this.existingFiles);
console.log('Files have IDs:', this.existingFiles.map(f => f.id));
```

## Expected Flow:
1. Frontend sends existing_files array with IDs
2. Backend receives the array in updateMultiple
3. Backend calls deletePaymentFiles with IDs to keep
4. Files not in the keep list get deleted

## Common Issues:
- File object missing id property
- FormData not sending existing_files
- Backend condition not triggered
- Array format incorrect
